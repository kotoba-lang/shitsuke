(ns shitsuke.re-frame
  "Tiny re-frame-shaped runtime — the portable host impl behind shitsuke.re-frame.core.

  The API is intentionally close to re-frame.core so app code written against
  `(:require [re-frame.core :as rf])` runs unchanged on JVM SSR / SCI / WASM hosts
  that cannot pull real re-frame. It stores everything in plain atoms and computes
  subscriptions synchronously (no reaction graph, no effects/cofx/interceptors).

  Deliberately absent (the portable subset, pinned by test/re_frame_test.cljc):
    reg-event-fx, reg-fx, reg-cofx, inject-cofx, interceptors,
    subscription chaining (<-), async dispatch queue, ratoms.

  For the browser build, shitsuke.re-frame.core delegates to real re-frame 1.4.3
  instead of this namespace (see re_frame_core.cljc)."
