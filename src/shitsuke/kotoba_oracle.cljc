(ns shitsuke.kotoba-oracle
  "Runs the shipped decision cores.

  `kotoba/*.kotoba` holds the decisions; `resources/shitsuke/oracle/*.kir.edn`
  is what was compiled from them and what ships. This namespace is the seam,
  and it is deliberately thin: it resolves a resource, executes an export, and
  decides nothing.

  ## Why this exists

  The six cores landed with `kotoba-parity-test` /
  `kotoba-document-parity-test`, which ran both implementations over the same
  inputs and required the same answers, and on 2026-08-12 with
  `kotoba-callable-test`, which proved each module exports a surface a host
  could call. Both were right and both are still here. But an export nobody
  calls is a door nobody walks through: until now the `.cljc` was what ran and
  the `.kotoba` was a checked replica. The measure of the port is not how many
  host lines went away, it is whether the AUTHORITY moved (ADR-2608112100).

  The one that most wanted this is `rawtext-breakout?`. It is a SECURITY
  predicate — whether a `<script>`/`<style>` payload contains the
  case-insensitive `</tag` sequence that terminates a RAWTEXT element early and
  lets markup be injected after it. A security rule that exists twice is a
  security rule that can be fixed once and stay broken in the copy that runs.

  ## The guest ABI, and the two places the host has to meet it

  `kir/execute` takes a record as `[schema field …]` in DECLARED field order
  and returns the same shape, so `record` is a positional constructor and
  nothing more. The declared order is not written down here: `signature` reads
  it back out of the shipped artifact, which IS the `.kotoba` compiled, so
  callers get the order from the source of the rule rather than from a host
  copy of it.

  Strings cross as UTF-8 and the guest refuses one over
  `string-byte-limit` bytes. `chars-that-always-fit` is that limit expressed in
  a unit a host can check without encoding anything (see its docstring); a host
  with a longer string windows it rather than asking a question the guest will
  not answer.

  ## No fallback around a missing artifact

  A missing or unreadable artifact throws. It does not quietly run something
  else, because a silent fallback is how a decision stops being the one that
  shipped — and for `rawtext-breakout?` it is also how an unchecked payload
  reaches a page.

  ## ClojureScript hosts must register the KIR

  There is no classpath to read a resource from, so `register-kir!` is the only
  way in and `kir` throws without it. That is a real narrowing of what this
  library used to do on that runtime, and because shitsuke is a design system
  that ClojureScript consumers require directly, it is stated here and in the
  README rather than left to be discovered.

  What it does NOT narrow is namespace loading. Nothing delegated here is
  evaluated at load time: every delegated call site is inside a function, so
  `(require '[shitsuke.hig])` on ClojureScript works exactly as before whether
  or not a KIR was ever registered. `shitsuke.hig/layer-order-css` and
  `shitsuke.hig/text-style-classes` stay host-side FOR that reason — they are
  top-level `def`s, and delegating them would make loading the design system
  depend on a registered artifact."
