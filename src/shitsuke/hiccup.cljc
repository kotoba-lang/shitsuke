(ns shitsuke.hiccup
  "Hiccup → HTML string renderer (.cljc, babashka-safe).

  This is the SSR twin of the reagent view contract: the SAME hiccup data that
  reagent renders live in the browser is rendered to an HTML string here for the
  static build (the kami-mangaka-reader dual-render pattern). It unifies the two
  near-identical emitters that previously lived in kami.mangaka.hiccup and
  slides.hiccup.

  Tag/attribute/style primitives and the RAWTEXT (script/style) breakout-guard
  are delegated to kotoba-lang/html (html.core) — the standalone substrate repo
  this implementation was originally extracted into (see that repo's README) —
  instead of duplicating them here, so fixes land once. The tree-walk itself
  stays local: html.core's own ->html additionally pretty-prints block-only
  element children (adds newlines/indentation), which would be a breaking
  output-format change for this namespace's many downstream consumers that
  depend on ->html's exact compact-string contract, so shitsuke.hiccup keeps
  its own compact (no added whitespace) walk and only reuses html.core's
  primitives + guard logic.
