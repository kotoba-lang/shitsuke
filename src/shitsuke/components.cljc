(ns shitsuke.components
  "Pure-hiccup UI primitives (.cljc, no reagent import).

  Each fn returns plain hiccup data (the kami-mangaka dual-render contract): the
  SAME data is rendered live by reagent in the browser and to HTML by
  shitsuke.hiccup/->html for SSR. Styling is via stable `shitsuke__<component>`
  classes (shitsuke.style/class-name) + token CSS vars (var(--shitsuke-...)),
  so the visual lives in the shadow-css :pages build, not inline.

  `act` is the portable interaction attribute: a keyword like :slides/new-deck.
  On :cljs the caller wraps it in :on-click (rf/dispatch [act ...]); on SSR the
  caller emits `data-act=\"<act>\"` and a thin enhancer dispatches on click
  (mirrors mangaka reader's wire-lang-switch! pattern)."

(defn- control-attrs
  "Shared attrs builder for the native text controls (`input`/`textarea`).

  - A caller `:on-input` is re-attached as `:on-change` when no `:on-change`
    is given (kept as-is when the caller wired both — an explicit `:on-change`
    always wins, never clobbered). React's `onChange` on text controls fires
    on the native `input` event, so the caller-visible semantics
    (per-keystroke, `(.. e -target -value)`) are identical — but the rename
    matters under reagent: reagent's async-rendering-safe controlled-input
    path (reagent.impl.input/input-render-setup) only engages when the props
    carry BOTH `value` and `onChange`. With `:value` + `:on-input` the control
    is a plain React controlled input under reagent's rAF-batched re-rendering:
    after every keystroke React restores the DOM to the last-*rendered* (stale)
    value, so any keystroke landing before the next render is typed into a
    reverted field and everything but the last keystroke is lost. Reproduced
    against reagent 1.2.0/React 18; root-caused downstream in
    kotoba-lang/liquid-glass-ui PR #3 (net-babiniku text fields).
  - Every other caller opt passes through untouched (`:on-key-down`,
    `:disabled`, `:aria-label`, `:maxLength`, ...); `:class` is appended to
    the base `shitsuke__<component>` class; `:act` maps to `:data-act`.
  - Pure data in → pure data out: equal opts produce `=` hiccup.

  `base` is the control-specific leading attrs (:id/:class/:type/:rows),
  passed pre-built so the emitted attribute order — and therefore the SSR
  HTML string — stays stable."
