(ns shitsuke.kotoba-guest-test
  "The SEAM around a Kotoba guest: registration, subscriptions, and what
  happens to the effects a guest handler asks for.

  Scope, stated because it is easy to overclaim: this test does NOT verify the
  guest. It verifies that `install-guest!` puts a guest behind `rf/dispatch`
  and `rf/subscribe` without those call sites changing, and that an effect the
  guest returned is performed exactly once, in order, AFTER the handler has
  returned -- which on the mini runtime means outside the `swap!`.

  The guest here is therefore a text function, not the compiled artifact. What
  the compiled artifact actually answers is pinned separately and end to end by
  `test/kotoba/guest_acceptance.cljs`, which builds
  `kotoba/example_counter.kotoba` with amu and calls the emitted ESM. Neither
  test is sufficient alone: this one would pass against a guest that never
  compiled, and that one says nothing about re-frame registration."
