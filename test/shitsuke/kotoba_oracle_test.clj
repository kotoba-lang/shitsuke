  "What keeps the shipped artifacts honest, now that they are what runs.

  `kotoba-parity-test` compiles each core fresh and compares it to the `.cljc`.
  `kotoba-callable-test` proves each module exports a surface a host COULD
  call. Both are still here and both are still right. Neither can see what
  matters once a host actually delegates, because both compile a module on the
  spot and neither reads `resources/shitsuke/oracle/`. Three things have to hold
  that did not have to before:

    1. the shipped artifact IS the current source, compiled
    2. the host actually reads it, rather than having quietly kept a copy
    3. what ships stays inside the slice that works on BOTH runtimes

  The second is the one that is easy to lose and impossible to see: a
  delegation that fell back to a host implementation would pass every parity
  test ever written, because a host copy is exactly what those tests compare
  against. So this asks the only question that separates them — swap in a core
  that answers the OPPOSITE and see whether the host follows. For
  `rawtext-breakout?` that substitution is the security question stated
  directly: a core that says \"no breakout\" when there is one must make
  `->html` emit the payload, and if it does not, something other than the
  shipped core is deciding."

  Gensym numbering is per-JVM and monotonic, so the artifact on disk was

  happens to be. Measured 2026-08-12: the shipped core contains no such symbol
  today, because it uses neither `and` nor `or` — which is exactly why
  this is here rather than an equality check. `and`/`or` lower to a `let` over
