  "Runs the DELEGATED RAWTEXT path under ClojureScript on Node.

      clojure -M:cljs-check

  This exists because a green JVM suite is not evidence about ClojureScript,
  and this delegation had two runtime-specific reasons to fail there.

  First, `shitsuke.kotoba-oracle` cannot read a resource on this runtime, so
  the seam must fail CLOSED — refuse rather than skip a security check. Step 1
  asserts the refusal itself, which is the one assertion that would be
  worthless on the JVM.

  Second, at the kir pin this library runs (838cd77c),
  `kotoba.kir.value/utf8-substring!` guards its offsets with `(integer? start)`,
  and an `:i64` is a `js/BigInt` here, for which that predicate is false. Any
  core reaching `string-substring` therefore throws on ClojureScript while
  passing on the JVM. `kotoba-oracle-test` pins structurally that no shipped
  core reaches it; this runs the thing and finds out.

  Not a `cljs.test` suite on purpose: this repo has no ClojureScript test
  runner, and adding one to assert twelve facts would be more moving parts than
  the facts. It exits non-zero on failure, which is what a gate needs."
