(ns shitsuke.kotoba-callable-test
  "Every `.kotoba` core ships a callable surface, not only a compilable one.

  `kotoba-parity-test` and `kotoba-document-parity-test` reach their modules by
  appending zero-argument case defns and compiling the result. That is fine for
  a test and impossible for a caller, and until 2026-08-12 it was the only way
  in: none of the six modules declared an `(:export …)`, and four of them
  carried a comment naming the harness as the reason. (`tokens_document` and
  `hig_document` carried no comment at all — they were silently unreachable.)

  The harness was not the reason. Measured 2026-08-12 against the pinned
  compiler (deps.edn c3be07fb), two other things were:

    1. Every module defines a `main` — mostly a smoke entry point that exists
       to satisfy the entryless-library rule — and a declared export list that
       omits it is refused with \"main entrypoint must be exported\".
    2. `ir/execute` runs exported functions only (\"function is not
       exported\"), so the harness's appended cases have to be named in the
       list too. That is one `str/replace-first` on the export vector, and it
       appends to whatever the module declares rather than restating it.

  So this asks each module, in the shape it ships, the two questions the parity
  tests structurally cannot, because those compile a rewritten module: does it
  compile with nothing appended, and does the export list mean anything.

  The interpreter is `kotoba.kir`, not `kotoba.compiler.ir`: the compiler pin
  this repo depends on carries no `src/kotoba/kir*` of its own and pulls
  kotoba-kir in transitively, which is the namespace both parity tests already
  require. Targets match the harness that gates each module — the form-A cores
  on `:wasm32-kotoba-v1`, the document cores on `:js-kotoba-v1` — so the
  shipped shape is checked on the target it is gated on."
